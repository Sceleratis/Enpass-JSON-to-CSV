# Enpass-JSON-to-CSV
Converts a JSON file containing exported logins from Enpass into a CSV file that can be imported by other passwords managers.

This was created to import logins from Enpass into Dashlane. The formatting for the CSV file generated by Enpass is basically unusable to Dashlane's importer (and likely many others.) My solution was to just export the data as JSON and use a Python script (this) to convert from JSON to a more managable CSV.

JSON file should be named "enpassRaw.json" and should be in the same directory as the script.

Use it if you happen to be in a similar boat finding you can't import exported Enpass logins.
